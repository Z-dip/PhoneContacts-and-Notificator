# PhoneContacts-and-Notificator
Simple app that lets you save names with phone numbers, or other numbers, and notificator app

I tried to create application that saves contacts and phone numbers. 
You can put there anything, but this app is not suited for very long sentences, since to delete certain one you need to rewrite all you want to delete.
Of course there is option to delete everything.
I am well aware that making this using map is really elegant and all, but i took this as challenge and I didnt use any collection.
Persistance is achieved through writing your input to text file.
In addition, there is notification app that lets you write certain task and schedule it for certain hour. This however doesnt use persistance,
so the app will run and "remember" certain time only until you turn off your pc. It is programmed to write time in minutes, eg. input = 5 = 5min.

Have fun
